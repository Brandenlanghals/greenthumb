# Green Thumb

Green Thumb is a simple platform for users to find and create events targeted at making communities cleaner, and offsetting our carbon footprint. Users can create and edit a profile, then find an event to participate in, or create an event for others to join.

## Future Updates
Making the app a mobile app is the biggest priority. This would allow events to be found or created on-the-go, and also allow you to help out wherever you may be. 
We would also like to build out the profiles functionality to make connections and enable group collaboration between users. Also, we would like to add a geolocation feature to only display events in your area.
